## Local Development

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v20` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the tests locally

Bring up the relevant Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

If you wish to test the logs or audit logs, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test:withLogs
```

By default the testing of logs is not enabled (And also not launched during the smoke test in Dev / Test). It is however enabled during PR builds.

The testing of logs and audit logs also assumes that you have run the Docker compose command above as it relies on the Dockerised `epr-backend` service.

### Running the tests on environments

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

### Running the data generator for epr-backend

This only applies to local builds. You can generate 50 organisation details, registrations and accreditations (all linked together) in one go with this command:

```
npm run generatedata
```

This will create mock datasets for the 3 collections in the database. Only to be used for local development purposes.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh`
